# Snake-game-C++
I created this game when I was in 3rd year of engg. I look at the code and wondering how I did this.

Usually in other games,snake eats up food and grows bigger.
In this game, the snake is eating food(F) and leaving shit(S) behind it.That shit(S) is like an obstacle.
If the snake's head touches its body or touches 'S', then GAME OVER.
Also, we can reverse the snake direction by 'R'.
Snake can pass thorugh walls.

->RUN this in Dev C++ compiler.

Input must be in CAPS only.
W- to move forward
A- to turn left
D- to turn right
S- to move downward
R- to reverse the snake
